npm (node package manager) is the dependency/package manager you get out of the box when you install Node.js. It provides a way for developers to install packages both globally and locally.

Sometimes you might want to take a look at a specific package and try out some commands. But you cannot do that without installing the dependencies in your local node_modules folder.

Thatâ€™s where npx comes in.

app.js 
|
return (
    <div className="App">---> className(it is a jsx -javascript syntax extension)
    |
    used className because class is a keyword in javascript so it is combination of html and js

using bootstrap (css framework) :https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/

added bootstrap script and css script from bootstrap startertemplate...,navbar

in jsx , we need to add a slash at the closing end of tag if the tag doesnot have closing tag ..eg hr,input

-we can also use bootstrap react : https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts
*npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@5.1.3

-propTypes : to impose strict datatype
-defaultProps :     default value of some var , use in navbar to understand 'title',searchBar

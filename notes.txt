npm (node package manager) is the dependency/package manager you get out of the box when you install Node.js. It provides a way for developers to install packages both globally and locally.

Sometimes you might want to take a look at a specific package and try out some commands. But you cannot do that without installing the dependencies in your local node_modules folder.

Thatâ€™s where npx comes in.
